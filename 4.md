... than what you've seen so far! There is a lot to learn about LFE, the tooling
around it, creating projects, bringing to bear 20 years of hardened telecom
experience from Erlang, deploying in production, etc. This guide just gives you
a quick taste of the LFE flavour :-) Before parting ways, though, there are
some more bits we should share.


### 4.1 The LFE REPL

We barely touched upon the LFE REPL in this guide; if you're like many other Lispers, you will spend a considerable amount of your dev (or at least planning) time in the REPL. More information on the LFE REPL is available in the following locations:

* <a href="https://github.com/rvirding/lfe/blob/develop/doc/lfe_shell.txt">LFE codebase docs - Lisp Flavoured Erlang shell</a>
* <a href="http://docs.lfe.io/user-guide/intro/2.html">User Guide - The LFE REPL</a>

### 4.2 More LFE

#### 4.2.1 The Official Tutorial

The "official" Erlang tutorial has been ported to LFE and is available as a Gitbook here:
 * https://www.gitbook.com/book/lfe/tutorial/details

There is still a bit of work for the authors to do before it is 100% complete, but it is useful right now. The topics covered include:

* **Sequential programming** - installing LFE, the REPL, functions, modules, data types, the standard library, writing to the terminal, pattern matching, guards, conditionals, built-in functions, and higher-order functions
* **Concurrent programming** - processes, message passing, registered processes, and distributed programming
* **Robustness** - timeouts and error handling
* **Records and macros** - header files, records, and macros

#### 4.2.2 Casting SPELs

If you are an "adventurous" sort, you can write your own text-based game using LFE message-pasing, state-managment, and even process closures in this rewrite of the Lisp classic:

#### 4.2.3 SICP, Chapter 1

For those with an interest in details, theory, and even history, the first chapter of The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs has been ported to LFE:

* https://www.gitbook.com/book/lfe/sicp/details

#### 4.2.4 LFE/OTP

If you'd like to learn more about OTP in LFE, there is a growing number of tutorials available on the LFE blog highlighting this topic:

### Next Stop

There are any number of things you could tackle next, depending upon your general programming experience, learning style, and interest in LFE. Here are some ideas:

* Read up on Erlang itself -- [the site](http://erlang.org/) has links to great Erlang books
* Read the source code for various projects in the [LFEX](https://github.com/lfex) organisation on Github
* [Watch LFE presentations](http://docs.lfe.io/presentations.html)
* Read up on [Lisp, Erlang, and LFE history](http://docs.lfe.io/history.html)
* Practice LFE and get feedback from the community by working through the [LFE Track on Exercism](http://exercism.io/languages/lfe)
* Fix a bug in:
  * [LFE Docs](https://github.com/lfe/docs/issues)
  * An [LFEX](https://github.com/lfex) project
  * [LFE itself](https://github.com/rvirding/lfe/)!
* Create a project of your own :-D
