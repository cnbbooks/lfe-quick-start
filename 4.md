... than what you've seen so far! There is a lot to learn about LFE, the tooling
around it, creating projects, bringing to bear 20 years of hardened telecom
experience from Erlang, deploying in production, etc. This guide just gives you
a quick taste of the LFE flavour :-) Before parting ways, though, there are
some more bits we should share.


### 4.1 The LFE Quick Start with ``lfetool``

There is [another version of the LFE Quick Start](http://lfe.gitbooks.io/lfetool-quick-start/content/) available that covers the same material, but using the community-contributed project and dependency management tool called [lfetool](https://github.com/lfe/lfetool/). The ``lfetool`` version of the Quick Start covers these additional topics:
 * Creating your first project
 * A Quick intro to TDD and running tests in LFE
 * Convenience ``make`` targets available to LFE projects created with ``lfetool``

``lfetool``'s original scope was the creation of skeleton scripts, library projects, and OTP applications -- taking care of the boilerplate for you. It has since grown to encompass such areas as
 * automatically locating dependencies and adding them to the ``ERL_LIBS`` so you have access to them without having to think about it. 
 * providing a custom test runner for LFE
 * running unit, system, and integration tests for projects
 * providing convenient ``make`` targets for generated projects


### 4.2 The LFE REPL

We barely touched upon the LFE REPL in this guide; if you're like many other Lispers, you will spend a considerable amount of your dev (or at least planning) time in the REPL. More information on the LFE REPL is available in the following locations:

* <a href="https://github.com/rvirding/lfe/blob/develop/doc/lfe_shell.txt">LFE codebase docs - Lisp Flavoured Erlang shell</a>
* <a href="http://docs.lfe.io/user-guide/intro/2.html">User Guide - The LFE REPL</a>


### 4.3 Additional Resources

### Next Stop

There are any number of things you could tackle next, depending upon your general programming experience, learning style, and interest in LFE. Here are some ideas:

* Read up on Erlang itself -- [the site](http://erlang.org/) has links to great Erlang books
* Read the source code for various projects in the [LFEX](https://github.com/lfex) organisation on Github
* [Watch LFE presentations](http://docs.lfe.io/presentations.html)
* Read up on [Lisp, Erlang, and LFE history](http://docs.lfe.io/history.html)
* Fix a bug in:
  * [LFE Docs](https://github.com/lfe/docs/issues)
  * An [LFEX](https://github.com/lfex) project
  * [LFE itself](https://github.com/rvirding/lfe/)!
* Create a project of your own :-D
